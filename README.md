# android-1.0

This folder "archive" contains the Android open source files that are part of Android version 1.0.
See more in the [README](archive/README.md).

Once you download these files on a Linux PC, use the [unzip.sh](archive/unzip.sh) shell script to recreate the android-1.0 source tree.

Instructions for building the source tree are coming soon ...
